    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p>
      This Privacy Policy applies to the app Season Palette ("the App"). Season
      Palette is committed to protecting your privacy.
    </p>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
      <p>
        The App collects the following types of information to provide its
        services:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Camera Access and Face Image:</strong> The App requests access
          to your device's camera to perform the color analysis. With your
          explicit permission, a single, still image of your face is captured.
          This image is used solely for the purpose of color analysis and is
          stored locally on your device (see "Data Retention").
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Device Information:</strong> We collect information about your
          device to ensure optimal performance and compatibility. This may
          include your device model (e.g., iPhone 13, Samsung Galaxy S22),
          operating system version (e.g., iOS 17.2, Android 14), and a unique
          device identifier that is *not* tied to your personal identity and is
          used only for analytical purposes. We do *not* collect any personally
          identifiable information through the device identifier.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>In-App Purchases:</strong> Information related to your
          purchases within the App is handled through Apple's StoreKit
          framework.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
      <p>We use the collected information for the following purposes:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          To provide and maintain the App's functionalities, including color
          analysis and personalized recommendations. The face image captured for
          color analysis is used exclusively to determine your optimal color
          palette. We send this image to Google's Gemini Developer API, a
          third-party service, for processing. We do not use this image for any
          other purpose, including but not limited to, advertising, user
          profiling, or training other AI models.
        </li>
        <li>To process in-app purchases and manage subscription services.</li>
        <li>To improve the App's performance and user experience.</li>
        <li>
          To communicate with you about updates, promotions, and other
          information related to the App.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>3. Sharing Your Information</h2>
      <p>
        Season Palette does not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer your personal
        information to outside parties except as described below:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Third-Party Services:</strong> We use the following
          third-party services:
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Google Gemini Developer API:</strong> As described above,
              we share the captured face image with Google's Gemini Developer
              API for color analysis.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Apple's StoreKit:</strong> This service is used to process
              in-app purchases and manage subscriptions. Apple handles all
              payment information directly, and we do not have access to your
              credit card details.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>SuperwallKit:</strong> We use SuperwallKit to manage and
              present in-app purchase options and subscriptions. SuperwallKit
              may collect anonymized data related to your interactions with
              purchase screens, such as which options you view or select. This
              data is used to improve the user experience and is not linked to
              your personal identity. You can review Superwall's privacy policy
              here:

              >.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Legal Requirements:</strong> We may disclose your information
          if required to do so by law or in response to valid requests by public
          authorities.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>4. Data Security</h2>
      <p>
        We take the security of your data seriously. We implement measures such
        as:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Storing the face image only within the app's secure, sandboxed storage
          on your device.
        </li>
        <li>
          Using secure connections (HTTPS) when transmitting data to third-party
          services like Google's Gemini API.
        </li>
        <li>
          Regularly reviewing our data handling practices to ensure they align
          with industry best practices.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        However, no method of transmission over the internet or electronic
        storage is 100% secure. While we strive to protect your information, we
        cannot guarantee its absolute security.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>5. Data Retention</h2>
      <p>
        The face image is exclusively stored locally on your device, residing
        within the app's dedicated and secure storage area. It is crucial to
        note that this image is never transmitted to or stored on our servers.
        Upon uninstallation of the app, the image is automatically and
        permanently deleted. Additionally, you retain the option to expedite the
        deletion process by clearing the app's data via your device's settings.
        It's important to understand that the retention of the image by Google
        is strictly governed by Google's Gemini Developer API privacy policies,
        which we encourage you to review for detailed information.
